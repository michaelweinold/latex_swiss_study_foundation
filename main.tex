\section{Authors}

Michael Weinold is a doctoral researcher at ETH Zurich and the Paul Scherrer Institute. With a background in physics, his academic research has been centered around accelerating innovation in clean-energy technologies. For his doctoral research project, he is improving the mathematical modeling of life-cycle assessment methods. A student of history and enthusiastic draftsman, he XXXX. Originally from Innsbruck, Austria.

Philippe Schultheiss is a philosopher who is currently training to become a priest with the reformed church of Zurich.

\section{Abstract}

We must reduce global carbon emissions dramatically. The construction sector is responsible for XX\% of annual global carbon emissions. In Switzerland, it accounts for XX\% of carbon emissions (including imported carbon). This number is expected to increase to XX\% in 2050, due to strong immigration.
What is more, the construction sector is notoriously difficult to decarbonise. Together with certain heavy industry sectors and aviation, it is classified as a "hard to abate" sector.
Work is ongoing on decreasing the carbon footprint of building during the construction phase and during the use phase. This includes novel methods for cement, concrete and steel production or the increasing digitisation of buildings ("smart home"). However, there are currently no efforts to increase the lifetime of buildings. In Switzerland, like in the surrounding EU countries, average building lifetime is around 50 years only.
The carbon emissions incurred during new construction of a building vs the refurbishment can be recouped over a period of between XX-XX years. Studies exist for the nordic countries, where the energy cost of non-refurbished buildings is highest. Average building lifetimes are between 50 years (France, with source) and 60 years (Switzerland, with source).
Despite efforts to improve recycling in construction, recycling rate of modern building materials (steel, concrete, glass) remains low (check for source).

At the same time, changing use requirements meet the modernist credo "form follows function". Changing family structures mean that apartments can be ever more compact.
All this amounts to large scale new construction, the majority of which is in the 'modernist' or contemporary style.
Every poll to date has shown that this style is at the very least moderately unpopular with people. Empirical evidence is mounting, thereby providing proof for something that has been well-known to the general public for a long time: "Why is the Modern World So Ugly?" (Alain de Boton)




A key reason for the short lifetime of buildings is the

\section{Scope of the Discussion}

Modern architecture is always ugly. Nonetheless, we limit our discussion to buildings of a representative nature. We exclude housing (eg. apartment complexes) to avoid:

\section{Scattered Thoughts}

Architects have been publicly calling for the public to be re-educated to appreciate their brutalist/modernist designs. (eg. the architects that build the Triemli Tower).

Some potential pathways to decarbonizing the economy are difficult for technical and political reasons. This includes "flying less", "reducing personal mobility", etc.
However, some aspects should be really simple: "don't design houses for a 50 year lifetime"

\section{Aesthetics}

\textit{"[Architecture] (...) is the most overweening of the arts, and the one that least lets us alone. A gallery we can't walk out of, a book we can't close, an art we can't even turn our back on because it is there facing us on the other side of the street as well (...)} - British poet Blake Morrison in "Lords of glass, steel and concrete" \cite{morrison_lords_1982}
