\section{\centering Abstract}

\begin{minipage}{0.55\textwidth}

    We must reduce global carbon emissions dramatically. The construction sector is responsible for XX\% of annual global carbon emissions. In Switzerland, it accounts for XX\% of carbon emissions (including imported carbon). This number is expected to increase to XX\% in 2050, due to strong immigration.
    
    What is more, the construction sector is notoriously difficult to decarbonise. Together with certain heavy industry sectors and aviation, it is classified as a "hard to abate" sector.
    
    Work is ongoing on decreasing the carbon footprint of building during the construction phase and during the use phase. This includes novel methods for cement, concrete and steel production or the increasing digitisation of buildings ("smart home"). However, there are currently no efforts to increase the lifetime of buildings. In Switzerland, like in the surrounding EU countries, average building lifetime is around 50 years only.
    
    The carbon emissions incurred during new construction of a building vs the refurbishment can be recouped over a period of between XX-XX years. Studies exist for the nordic countries, where the energy cost of non-refurbished buildings is highest. Average building lifetimes are between 50 years (France, with source) and 60 years (Switzerland, with source).
    
    Despite efforts to improve recycling in construction, recycling rate of modern building materials (steel, concrete, glass) remains low (check for source).

    At the same time, changing use requirements meet the modernist credo "form follows function". Changing family structures mean that apartments can be ever more compact.
    
    All this amounts to large scale new construction, the majority of which is in the 'modernist' or contemporary style.
    
    Every poll to date has shown that this style is at the very least moderately unpopular with people. Empirical evidence is mounting, thereby providing proof for something that has been well-known to the general public for a long time: "Why is the Modern World So Ugly?" (Alain de Boton)

\section{The Age of Construction}
\label{sec:construction}

\begin{multicols}{2}

Recent data collected by the International Energy Agency shows that the construction of new buildings is expected to add a floor area equivalent to the surface of the city of Paris every week all the way through 2050 \cite[Sec. 3.7]{cozzi_net_2021}.

At the same time, the urban planning offices of several European countries expect and plan for an average service life of newly constructed buildings on the order of only 50 years. The exact lifetime depends on a number of factors, including the purpose of the structure (data for Denmark: 100 years for single-family homes, 75 years for cultural buildings and 50 years for health or teaching buildings \cite{andersen_lifespan_2023}). Further significant differences between the age of the building stock between different countries exist, with buildings in France having a significantly shorter lifetime \cite{noauthor_value_2013} than those in Switzerland \cite{kornmann_service_2012}.

An in-depth investigation of the underlying reasons for the short service life of the majority of the building stock remains an area of active research. In the context of this proposal, we will mention only two:

First, the changing demand structure in the context of residential buildings.

Ongoing societal transformations have driven a continuing trend towards fewer children per family and an increase of single-person households. This trend is illustrated in \cref{fig:households}. New construction of residential buildings is therefore seen as an opportunity to increase urban density by catering to smaller households, avoiding often equally expensive large-scale structural modifications of existing building stock. This trend is so significant that despite low birth rates in industrialized nations, the number of households has grown significantly, even without accounting for migration \cite{noauthor_why_2014}.

It should be noted that the degree of bi-directional causality between an increasing supply of smaller dwellings and family size at the advanced state of this trend has not been conclusively investigated \cite{kulu_fertility_2007}. For instance, the 2021 edition of the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey showed fertility rates for occupants of single-family homes to be significantly larger than occupants of apartment buildings \cite{noauthor_american_2021}. Decreasing the supply of larger dwellings on the housing market could induce a feedback loop, whereby the decreasing space of apartments decreases statistical fertility, necessitating even more new construction.

The figure illustrated how the average number of people living in a household has been shrinking in developed countries for centuries, with the pace of this change accelerating in the early 1900s. A statistical analysis of the data by the authors of the original study shows 
        a significant change in the trend of household size for developed nations around the year 1893. The authors concluded: \textit{"the number of households grew faster than population size in every country and every time period."}.

Second, the "diminishing climate returns" of extending building service-life.

The construction and maintenance of buildings in 2022 was responsible for 40\% of global carbon emissions \cite{camarasa_energy_2023}. Consequently, policy makers have been focusing on \textit{"accelerating and rapidly scaling up energy efficiency measures"} in the construction sector \cite{noauthor_2022_2022}. Researchers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group for Climate Change Mitigation in recently re-affirmed the emissions reduction potential that the sector offered. Proposed measures include improving existing buildings efficiency and use, high-performance new buildings, integrating renewable energy production in buildings, and decarbonizing production of building materials \cite{shukla_mitigation_2022}.

In this context, the energy expenditure and associated carbon emissions of the construction sector have recently come under increasing scrutiny from researchers in the field of industrial ecology, life-cycle assessment and sustainable construction \cite{chau_review_2015}\cite{ortiz_sustainability_2009}. A key finding is illustrated in \cref{fig:energy}: While extending the lifetime of buildings decreases the carbon emissions associated with its use, this effect naturally decreases over the lifetime of the building, as the recurrent carbon emissions from necessary refurbishment accumulate. Constructing an entirely new building to higher energy efficiency standards is therefore often seen as the preferable option for buildings over a certain age.

This, of course, is in contrast to World Green Building Council: \textit{"The most sustainable building is ironically, the one not built"}

\textit{"Reducing the use of high-volume, carbon-intensive materials such as concrete, steel and plastics, and replacing them with low-carbon and circular alternatives, should be the main approach."} \cite[Sec. 7.4]{noauthor_2022_2022}

Ultimately, many proposed to decarbonize the economy are challenging for technical and political reasons. This includes a reduction of personal mobility, additional taxes on flights or the electrification of sectors with \textit{hard to abate} carbon emissions. At the same time, some of the most straightforward pathways remain unexplored - for instance: \textit{"Don't design houses for a 50 year service life."}.

In this case, the figure show that the majority of energy is expended on the reconstruction ("initial"). On the other hand, a building lifetime of 150 years assumes that house is never torn down in the investigated timeframe. In this case, the figure shows that the majority of the energy is expended on refurbishment and renovation ("recurrent").

\section{The Age of Un-Aesthetics}
\label{sec:aesthetics}

\begin{multicols}{2}
    
The Swiss-British philosopher Alain de Botton of \textit{"School of Life"} fame in 2021 published an essay titled \textit{"Why is the modern world so ugly?"} \cite{howarth_why_2021}.  likens the development of modern architectural aesthetics to a “war on beauty”, in which a supposedly objective standard of attractiveness has been sacrificed at the altar of originality, resulting in built landscapes that not only violate their inhabitants’ supposedly natural sense of organic beauty but also assault their mental wellbeing. The essay communicated ideas that Botton had developed in an earlier book \textit{"The Architecture of Happiness"}. The essay was promptly decried by \cite{rogan_trads_2021}, without presenting substantive evidence against Botton's main claims: That the majority of modern architecture was widely rejected by the general public. 

This case-study replicates an established pattern in the present architectural community. Mounting evidence that the majority of buildings is perceived as \textit{ulgy}, or at the very least \textit{not beautiful} by the public, followed by calls of architects to ignore the vulgar tastes of the public. 

Three large-scale polls on architectural preferences have been conducted during the past ten years, all replicating the same result. A poll conducted by YouGov in the United Kingdom (sample size $>$1000) \cite{noauthor_yougov_2009}, a poll conducted by The Harris Poll in the United States (sample size $>$2000) \cite{noauthor_americans_2020} and a poll conducted by the Center for Urban and Real Estate Management of the University of Zurich (sample size $>$2000) \cite{hollenstein_schone_2022} \footnote{It should be noted that despite the best efforts of the authors, no scientific study or poll was found that provided evidence to the contrary. Without any claim to completeness, we can therefore say XXXXX}.

Shown in \cref{fig:federal_buildings} is a sample from the U.S. poll.




As we have seen illustrated in the proclamations of Corbusier and XXX, "Taste is subjective" (and we must take part in) has always been the the refuge of modernists. Corbusier said that the public had to be re-educated, and others have wondered about the vulgarity of designs for the public and asked whether architects should take these architectural tastes seriously.

The concept of beauty in architecture has sparked ceaseless and unresolved discussions and controversies. This mirrors equivalent discussions by philosophers from Plato (Symposium, ca. 370BC \cite{plato_symposium_1795}) to David Hume (Four Dissertations: On the Standard of Taste, 1757 \cite{hume_iv_1757}). To Plato, beauty was far from subjective - thereby a beautiful building would be one that has order, symmetry, proportion, harmony, and purpose, and that reveals the essence and goodness of the Form of Beauty. To Hume, beauty was not an inherent property of an object but purely subjective - a beautiful building would be one that pleases the taste of a true judge, who has a refined and cultivated ability to perceive and appreciate beauty, based on experience, comparison, and reflection (an "Architect").

Neuroscience and psychology have only recently been able to contribute significantly to this debate. Research interest in the concept of beauty in architecture has increased exponentially over the past 20 years. Following a preliminary literature review, we found that the research, so far, has been conclusive:

% \footnote{The Elsevier Scopus scientific publication database clearly shows this trend. A search query for publications exploring the relationship between beauty in architecture in the context of psychology and neurology shows an exponential increase: \texttt{TITLE-ABS-KEY((architecture AND beauty) AND (psycho* OR neuro*))}} 

\textit{"Built spaces that facilitate a feeling of awe may have far-reaching positive effects on health and prosocial behaviors."} \newline - Negami et al. (2023) \cite{negami_how_2023}

\textit{"(Fractals) needs to reintegrate with biophilic and traditional architecture in urban design for their proven positive effects on health and well-being. Such beneﬁts include striking reductions in observers’ stress and mental fatigue."} \newline - Brielmann et al. (2022) \cite{brielmann_what_2022}.

\textit{"Built environments that integrate representations of the natural world into façades and interiors benefit occupant psycho-physiological wellbeing and behavior. However, the biophilic quality of buildings does not depend exclusively on “green”, but also upon “organized complexity” in their structure."} - Berto et al. (2022) \cite{berto_biophilic_2022}

\textit{"(...) greenery and other natural features in the built environment may improve mood (...) and accelerate recovery from stress and surgery.} \newline - Coburn et al. (2017) \cite{coburn_buildings_2017}

Unaffected by the intellectual debate on the exact ontological nature of beauty, large-scale scientific studies have advanced our understanding of the aesthetic features which endow the built environment with healing qualities. Initial results point to natural forms, which for millennia have inspired the design of man-made structures, and the many geometric forms that take inspiration from them. Absent in modernist designs, they permeate the facades of many historical buildings in Europe and beyond. Lavdas and Salingaros have gone furthest, proposing a methodology to determine what they blodly claim to be an \textit{"objective measure for beauty"}, as shown in \cref{fig:heatmap}. t Could it be that \textit{"the architect has no clothes"} \cite{mehaffy_architect_2011}?

\section{The Age of Democracy}
\label{sec:democracy}

\begin{multicols}{2}

While the role of art in a free society remains a topic of philosophical debate, contemporary scholars agree that the role of art in democracy can be non-exhaustively defined as \textit{a mode of participation and action that engages the public in dialogue and debate, and that inspires social change and transformation}. Art thereby can be seen not only as the highest form of self-expression but also as a vital element of the democratic process.

Architecture, unlike some of the fine arts, generally serves an immediate purpose beyond that of aesthetic or intellectual expression. In this way it can perhaps most graciously be described as adding to- and expanding on the functionality which civil engineers involved in any construction project aim to provide. This makes the designs of architects ubiquitous. As a result of this omnipresence in public space, it has been recognized as being

\textit{"(...) the most overweening of the arts, and the one that least lets us alone. A gallery we can't walk out of, a book we can't close, an art we can't even turn our back on because it is there facing us on the other side of the street as well (...)} - British poet Blake Morrison in "Lords of Glass, Steel and Concrete" \cite{morrison_lords_1982}

Switzerland is consistently ranked as of the most democratic nations globally \cite{noauthor_economist_2023} with the principles of subsidiarity and direct democracy forming a vital part of Swiss national identity. At the same time, home ownership remains elusive for the majority of the population, having stagnated at around 40\% over the past decades \cite{noauthor_home_2022}. Aesthetic decisions are therefore further removed from the population. The majority of propoerties that is rented out, is owned by large corporations \cite{noauthor_wem_nodate}.

We have already shown in \cref{sec:aesthetics} that a number of polls and scientific studies have replicated the same finding: A cross-cultural rejection of the aesthetic language of modernism and internationalism. In fact, a sentiment that was brought to prominence by Swiss architect Le Corbusier is that of calling for a re-education of the public such that they might come to appreciate their brutalist/modernist designs. The modern version of this is perhaps best exemplified by the reaction of Corbu's compatriot Rudolf Guyer, who in 1955 designed a high-rise residential apartment in southern Zurich. When the building was voted "Switzerland's ugiest building" in 2018 by readers of the daily newspaper \textit{20 Minuten}, he declared:

\textit{"Dass Laien das Gebäude hässlich finden, ist mir egal. Hauptsache, den anderen Architekten gefällt es."} (en.: I don't care that laypeople find the building ugly. The main thing is that the other architects like it) 

So what does it say about the relationship between art and architecture and the public if perhaps the most inescapable form of public art is being rejected by the majority of the population? This questions is multi-facetted, branching into economics, psychology and philosophy.

We mention only one possible solution to this problem: A "revolt against 'ugly' modern architecture" \cite{gersten_scandinavian_2023}

\cref{fig:vienna} and \cref{fig:budaptest} show two diametrically opposed approaches to the replacement of existing building stock in cities that share a similar socio-economic and architectural legacy. 

In fact, we can observe that there is a kind of self-propagating effect: architectural prizes are given out only by architects. There is no 'public vote'. The contempt with which architects have treated the public is by no means covert.
