\section{Scattered Thoughts}

Architects have been publicly calling for the public to be re-educated to appreciate their brutalist/modernist designs. (eg. the architects that build the Triemli Tower).

Some potential pathways to decarbonizing the economy are difficult for technical and political reasons. This includes "flying less", "reducing personal mobility", etc.
