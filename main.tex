\section{\centering Abstract}

\begin{minipage}{0.55\textwidth}
    We must reduce global carbon emissions dramatically. The construction sector is responsible for XX\% of annual global carbon emissions. In Switzerland, it accounts for XX\% of carbon emissions (including imported carbon). This number is expected to increase to XX\% in 2050, due to strong immigration.
    
    What is more, the construction sector is notoriously difficult to decarbonise. Together with certain heavy industry sectors and aviation, it is classified as a "hard to abate" sector.
    
    Work is ongoing on decreasing the carbon footprint of building during the construction phase and during the use phase. This includes novel methods for cement, concrete and steel production or the increasing digitisation of buildings ("smart home"). However, there are currently no efforts to increase the lifetime of buildings. In Switzerland, like in the surrounding EU countries, average building lifetime is around 50 years only.
    
    The carbon emissions incurred during new construction of a building vs the refurbishment can be recouped over a period of between XX-XX years. Studies exist for the nordic countries, where the energy cost of non-refurbished buildings is highest. Average building lifetimes are between 50 years (France, with source) and 60 years (Switzerland, with source).
    
    Despite efforts to improve recycling in construction, recycling rate of modern building materials (steel, concrete, glass) remains low (check for source).

    At the same time, changing use requirements meet the modernist credo "form follows function". Changing family structures mean that apartments can be ever more compact.
    
    All this amounts to large scale new construction, the majority of which is in the 'modernist' or contemporary style.
    
    Every poll to date has shown that this style is at the very least moderately unpopular with people. Empirical evidence is mounting, thereby providing proof for something that has been well-known to the general public for a long time: "Why is the Modern World So Ugly?" (Alain de Boton)

The functional unit of the assessment is the provisioning of the case-study building over a period of 150 years. A building lifetime of 15 years assumes that the house is torn down and rebuilt 10 times during the 150 year investigated timeframe. In this case, the figure show that the majority of energy is expended on the reconstruction ("initial"). On the other hand, a building lifetime of 150 years assumes that house is never torn down in the investigated timeframe. In this case, the figure shows that the majority of the energy is expended on refurbishment and renovation ("recurrent").

\section{Construction and Aesthetics}

Modern architecture is always ugly. Nonetheless, we limit our discussion to buildings of a representative nature. We exclude housing (eg. apartment complexes) to avoid:

\section{Proposed Agenda}

\section{Proposed Speakers}

\section{Scattered Thoughts}

Architects have been publicly calling for the public to be re-educated to appreciate their brutalist/modernist designs. (eg. the architects that build the Triemli Tower).

Some potential pathways to decarbonizing the economy are difficult for technical and political reasons. This includes "flying less", "reducing personal mobility", etc.
However, some aspects should be really simple: "don't design houses for a 50 year lifetime"

\section{"Why is the modern world so ugly?}

\subsection{Mounting Empirical Evidence}

As we have seen illustrated in the proclamations of Corbusier and XXX, "Taste is subjective" (and we must take part in) has always been the the refuge of modernists. Corbusier said that the public had to be re-educated, and others have wondered about the vulgarity of designs for the public and asked whether architects should take these architectural tastes seriously.

\subsection{A matter of taste?}

\subsection{Re-educating the general public}

In fact, we can observe that there is a kind of self-propagating effect: architectural prizes are given out only by architects. There is no 'public vote'. The contempt with which architects have treated the public is by no means covert. This is perhaps best exemplified by the reaction of Rudolf Guyer, who in 1955 designed a high-rise residential apartment in souther Zurich. When the building was voted "Switzerland's ugiest building" in 2018 by readers of the daily newspaper \textit{20 Minuten}, he declared:

\textit{"Dass Laien das Gebäude hässlich finden, ist mir egal. Hauptsache, den anderen Architekten gefällt es."} (en.: I don't care that laypeople find the building ugly. The main thing is that the other architects like it)

\section{Proposed Speakers}
\subsection{Day 1: History of Architecture}

Pending recommendations by Samuel Leder et al.
Ideally some scholars of art and/or architectural history.
If we can get at least \textit{one} architect here, we could avoid questions of the sort "Why don't you have any architects among the speakers?".

eg. in the example of church architecture
church architecture as case study of representative architecture
Hundertwasser - how to include him?


\subsection{Day 2: Sustainability in the Built Environment}

Pending recommendations by Romain Sacchi and Xiaojin Zhang.
I could also ask Martin Röck if he can either recommend someone or if he wants to take part himself.
Could be someone from ETH, as long as they're interesting enough.
We could do some simple LCA calculations (using Brightway Live) to show the differences between
