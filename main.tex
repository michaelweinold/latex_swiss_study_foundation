\section*{\centering Authors}

\textbf{\textit{Michael P. Weinold}} (born 1995 in Innsbruck, Austria) is a doctoral researcher at ETH Zurich and Paul Scherrer Institute. His research is focused on accelerating innovation in clean-energy technologies. He has a  background in engineering physics.

\textbf{\textit{Philippe Schultheiss}} (born 1984 in Basel, Switzerland) was formally trained in philosophy and economics at the universities of Basel and Fribourg. He presently works as an independent consultant, coach and author. At the same time, he is the President of the Parliament of Europe's largest church community since 2020, alongside pursuing theology studies at the University of Zurich since fall 2021. 

\textbf{\textit{Mark C. Ballandies}} (born 1991 in Burgwedel, Germany) is a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computational Social Sciences at ETH Zurich.

\section{\centering Abstract}

\begin{minipage}{0.55\textwidth}
    We must reduce global carbon emissions dramatically. The construction sector is responsible for XX\% of annual global carbon emissions. In Switzerland, it accounts for XX\% of carbon emissions (including imported carbon). This number is expected to increase to XX\% in 2050, due to strong immigration.
    
    What is more, the construction sector is notoriously difficult to decarbonise. Together with certain heavy industry sectors and aviation, it is classified as a "hard to abate" sector.
    
    Work is ongoing on decreasing the carbon footprint of building during the construction phase and during the use phase. This includes novel methods for cement, concrete and steel production or the increasing digitisation of buildings ("smart home"). However, there are currently no efforts to increase the lifetime of buildings. In Switzerland, like in the surrounding EU countries, average building lifetime is around 50 years only.
    
    The carbon emissions incurred during new construction of a building vs the refurbishment can be recouped over a period of between XX-XX years. Studies exist for the nordic countries, where the energy cost of non-refurbished buildings is highest. Average building lifetimes are between 50 years (France, with source) and 60 years (Switzerland, with source).
    
    Despite efforts to improve recycling in construction, recycling rate of modern building materials (steel, concrete, glass) remains low (check for source).

    At the same time, changing use requirements meet the modernist credo "form follows function". Changing family structures mean that apartments can be ever more compact.
    
    All this amounts to large scale new construction, the majority of which is in the 'modernist' or contemporary style.
    
    Every poll to date has shown that this style is at the very least moderately unpopular with people. Empirical evidence is mounting, thereby providing proof for something that has been well-known to the general public for a long time: "Why is the Modern World So Ugly?" (Alain de Boton)

\section{Construction and Aesthetics}

Modern architecture is always ugly. Nonetheless, we limit our discussion to buildings of a representative nature. We exclude housing (eg. apartment complexes) to avoid:

\section{Proposed Agenda}

\section{Proposed Speakers}

\section{Scattered Thoughts}

Architects have been publicly calling for the public to be re-educated to appreciate their brutalist/modernist designs. (eg. the architects that build the Triemli Tower).

Some potential pathways to decarbonizing the economy are difficult for technical and political reasons. This includes "flying less", "reducing personal mobility", etc.
However, some aspects should be really simple: "don't design houses for a 50 year lifetime"

\section{"Why is the modern world so ugly?}

\subsection{Mounting Empirical Evidence}

As we have seen illustrated in the proclamations of Corbusier and XXX, "Taste is subjective" (and we must take part in) has always been the the refuge of modernists. Corbusier said that the public had to be re-educated, and others have wondered about the vulgarity of designs for the public and asked whether architects should take these architectural tastes seriously.

\subsection{A matter of taste?}

\subsection{Re-educating the general public}

In fact, we can observe that there is a kind of self-propagating effect: architectural prizes are given out only by architects. There is no 'public vote'. The contempt with which architects have treated the public is by no means covert. This is perhaps best exemplified by the reaction of Rudolf Guyer, who in 1955 designed a high-rise residential apartment in souther Zurich. When the building was voted "Switzerland's ugiest building" in 2018 by readers of the daily newspaper \textit{20 Minuten}, he declared:

\textit{"Dass Laien das Gebäude hässlich finden, ist mir egal. Hauptsache, den anderen Architekten gefällt es."} (en.: I don't care that laypeople find the building ugly. The main thing is that the other architects like it)
