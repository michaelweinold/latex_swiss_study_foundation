	abstract = {The Bosco Verticale (Vertical Forest) is a complex of two residential skyscrapers designed by Boeri Studio (Stefano Boeri, Gianandrea Barreca, and Giovanni La Varra) and located in the Porta Nuova district of Milan, Italy. They have a height of 116 metres (381 ft) and 84 m (276 ft) and within the complex is an 11-storey office building.The distinctive feature of the skyscrapers, both inaugurated in 2014, is the presence of over two thousand tree species, including tall shrubs and trees, distributed on the facades. It is an ambitious project of metropolitan reforestation that aims to increase the biodiversity of plant and animal species in the Lombard capital through vertical greening, reducing urban sprawl and contributing to the mitigation of the microclimate.The Bosco Verticale has received recognition in the architectural community, winning numerous awards. In addition to the International Highrise Award in 2014, it was acknowledged by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat as the "most beautiful and innovative skyscraper in the world" in 2015 and as one of the "fifty most iconic skyscrapers in the world" in 2019. The prototype of the Milanese project will be replicated in other cities.},

            A burgeoning interest in the intersection of neuroscience and architecture promises to offer biologically inspired insights into the design of spaces. The goal of such interdisciplinary approaches to architecture is to motivate construction of environments that would contribute to peoples' flourishing in behavior, health, and well-being. We suggest that this nascent field of neuroarchitecture is at a pivotal point in which neuroscience and architecture are poised to extend to a neuroscience of architecture. In such a research program, architectural experiences themselves are the target of neuroscientific inquiry. Here, we draw lessons from recent developments in neuroaesthetics to suggest how neuroarchitecture might mature into an experimental science. We review the extant literature and offer an initial framework from which to contextualize such research. Finally, we outline theoretical and technical challenges that lie ahead.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the environmental implications of long-term historical trends in household size. This paper presents the ﬁrst historical assessment of global shifts in average household size based on a variety of datasets covering the period 1600–2000. Findings reveal that developed nations reached a threshold in 1893 when average household size began to drop rapidly from approximately 5.0 to 2.5. A similar threshold was reached in developing nations in 1987. With the notable exceptions of Ireland, and England and Wales in the early 1800s, and India and the Seychelles in the late 1900s, the number of households grew faster than population size in every country and every time period. These ﬁndings suggest accommodating housing may continue to pose one of the greatest environmental challenges of the twenty-ﬁrst century because the impacts of increased housing present a threat to sustainability even when population growth slows. Future research addressing environmental impacts of declining household size could use an adapted IPAT model, I = PHoG: where environmental impact (I) = population 9 personal goods (P) ? households 9 household goods (HoG).},

While the effect of family changes on housing choices has been studied in detail, little is known about childbearing patterns within various housing types, and this despite the fact that many studies suggest housing to be an important determinant of fertility. We use longitudinal register data from Finland and apply hazard regression. First, we observe a significant variation in fertility levels across housing types – fertility is highest among couples living in single-family houses and lowest among those residing in apartments, with the variation remaining significant even after controlling for the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of women. Second, our results show elevated fertility levels after couples have changed dwellings, suggesting that much of the fertility variation across housing types is attributed to selective moves. Third, the study reveals a relatively high risk of third birth for couples in single-family houses several years after the move. This suggests that living in spacious housing and in a family-friendly environment for a relatively long time leads to higher fertility.},

The three streams are Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Life Cycle Energy Assessment (LCEA) and Life Cycle Carbon Emissions Assessment (LCCO2A). They were compared against their evaluation objectives, methodologies, and ﬁndings. Although they share similar objectives in evaluating the environmental impacts over the life cycle of building construction, they show some differences in the major focuses of evaluation and methodologies employed. Generally, it has been revealed that quite consistent results can be derived from the three streams with regard to the relative contribution of different phases of life cycle. However, discrepancies occur among the ﬁndings obtained from the three streams when different compositions of fuel mixes are used in power generation, or when the overall impacts are not contributed mostly by greenhouse gases emissions. The use of different functional units in different studies also makes it difﬁcult to compare results with benchmarks or results from previous studies. Besides, there are drawbacks in boundary scoping, methodology framework, data inventory and practices which impair their usefulness as a decision making support tool for sustainable building designs.},

While direct emissions from infrastructure use are well-known, information about indirect emissions from their construction is highly fragmented. Here, we estimated the carbon footprint of the existing global infrastructure stock in 2008, assuming current technologies, to be 122 (−20/+15) Gt CO2. The average percapita carbon footprint of infrastructures in industrialized countries (53 (±6) t CO2) was approximately 5 times larger that that of developing countries (10 (±1) t CO2). A globalization of Western infrastructure stocks using current technologies would cause approximately 350 Gt CO2 from materials production, which corresponds to about 35−60\% of the remaining carbon budget available until 2050 if the average temperature increase is to be limited to 2 °C, and could thus compromise the 2 °C target. A promising but poorly explored mitigation option is to build new settlements using less emissionsintensive materials, for example by urban design; however, this strategy is constrained by a lack of bottom-up data on material stocks in infrastructures. Infrastructure development must be considered in post-Kyoto climate change agreements if developing countries are to participate on a fair basis.},

To overcome this limitation in present studies, we must improve the quality of future aircraft efficiency forecasts.

	abstract = {Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is currently one of the construction industry’s most widely used methods of environmental assessment. Because LCA calculations is based on life-cycle thinking are the lifespan of the building a sensitive parameter in relation to the calculated overall environmental impact of the building. More accurate assessments of the lifespans of buildings are therefore a prerequisite for reducing errors and uncertainties in LCA and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) calculations. This study evaluates a generalized logistic lifespan prediction model for existing building typologies. The model is tested as part of a Danish case study based on building data collected from 124,096 cases of demolition. The objective is to investigate whether the typical lifespan used in LCA or LCC calculations accurately describes the remaining service life of existing buildings based on different building typologies and construction periods. The study show that office buildings generally have much shorter expected lifespans than previously assumed and that multi-family housing has nearly twice the lifespan of single-family housing. The results show a tendency for a declining lifespan based on the construction period, in which newer buildings, i.e. those that are no more than thirty years old, have a lifespan that is much shorter than the average lifespan for all construction periods. These results are highly relevant for both LCA and LCC calculations of buildings since they indicate that newer buildings in northern Europe have a lower lifespan than previous studies have shown.},

The index includes 167 countries and territories, of which 166 are sovereign states and 164 are UN member states. The index is based on 60 indicators grouped in five categories, measuring pluralism, civil liberties, and political culture. In addition to a numeric score and a ranking, the index categorizes each country into one of four regime types: full democracies, flawed democracies, hybrid regimes, and authoritarian regimes. The first Democracy Index report was published in 2006. Reports were published every two years until 2010 and annually thereafter.},

We developed a scale to rate 60 photographs of interior spaces on 24 architectural properties each and measured affective response to each of these spaces in a sample of undergraduate participants (N = 41). A regression model showed a predictive relationship between architectural properties and elicited emotion. Properties reﬂecting immensity and adornment, as well as sanctity of a space, signiﬁcantly and uniquely predicted a feeling of awe. Beyond furthering our understanding of awe, the present work presents compelling possibilities for our ﬁndings to be extended to evidence-based design.},

It examines sociological research undertaken in Concepción, Chile into the aesthetic tastes of people who have a relation to architecture or the arts and those with no relationship. The aim is to compare these groups in order to establish whether there is any difference in which house they aesthetically prefer and why. It must be noted that the sample was small and localized. Nor were all potentially significant elements beyond the façade perfectly controlled for (For example, the presence of grass or cars). Nevertheless, this study strongly supports previous research finding a measurable dissociation between the buildings most architects prefer aesthetically and those that the general public prefer. It suggests that such a ‘design disconnect’ is not just restricted to the UK or to Canada where it has previously been observed.},

User satisfaction is one of the main problems for the architect, which can be caused by differences in the cognitive and physical bases of opinions between architects and laypersons. An important factor for architects is to understand how laypersons would judge different physical cues that are aesthetically used in building façades. This study aims to identify the different cognitive properties between architects and laypersons. Previous studies have concentrated on conceptual properties, instead of cognitive properties of buildings. Although few studies have been concentrating on what might be called formal aesthetics, none of them focused on residential apartment façades. This study attempts to identify the differences between architects and laypersons in terms of aesthetic evaluation of building façade using quantitative survey. As a result, it can be concluded that although there are differences between architects and non-architects in aesthetics evaluation, both groups have scored certain similar physical cues. Findings of this research could help architects to form a better understanding of what laypersons would prefer in their ideal design.},

	abstract = {Built environments that integrate representations of the natural world into façades and interiors benefit occupant psycho-physiological wellbeing and behavior. However, the biophilic quality of buildings does not depend exclusively on “green”, but also upon “organized complexity” in their structure. In this exploratory study we compare quantitative (Visual Attention Software) and qualitative approaches (self-rating scales) in the perception of biophilic design of building façades. Eight façades varying in their degree of biophilic design (High, Medium, Low, No biophilic qualities) were assessed on the Perceived Restorativeness Scale-11, on preference, and on a series of physical aesthetic attributes. The eight façades were scanned with Visual Attention Software (VAS). These measures show many overlapping points. VAS can be considered a way to operationalize the engagement of attention in the first 3-5 seconds of gaze in exploring building design, and self-ratings assessments a measure of to what extent the building is perceived as restorative. Higher perceived restorativeness and preference match a higher degree of biophilic design, which corresponds to a building where vegetation is integrated in an organic structure. Vegetation is not the only biophilic characteristic to be considered in biophilic design and this emerges clearly from self-ratings and VAS. Exploring organized complexity is fundamental for understanding human responses to architecture.},

We find statistically and economically significant price differences for houses from distinct architectural styles across an array of specifications and modeling assumptions. Comparisons between classifications from ML models and human experts illustrate the conditions under which ML classifiers may perform at least as reliable as human experts in mass appraisal models. Hedonic estimates illustrate that the impact of architectural style on price is attenuated by properties with less welldefined styles and we find no evidence for differential price effects of Revival or Contemporary architecture for new construction.},

	abstract = {The building sector is responsible for signiﬁcant energy demands. An understanding of where this occurs across the building life cycle is critical for optimal targeting of energy reduction efforts. The energy embodied in a building can be signiﬁcant, yet is not well understood, especially the on-going ‘recurrent’ embodied energy associated with material replacement and building refurbishment. A key factor affecting this ‘recurrent’ embodied energy is a building's service life. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the service life and the life cycle embodied energy of buildings. The embodied energy of a detached residential building was calculated for a building service life range of 1 e150 years. The results show that variations in building service life can have a considerable effect on the life cycle embodied energy demand of a building. A 29\% reduction in life cycle embodied energy was found for the case study building by extending its life from 50 to 150 years. This indicates the importance of including recurrent embodied energy in building life cycle energy analyses as well as integrating building service life considerations when designing and managing buildings for improved energy performance.},

            Der Evolutionsbiologe Ernst Haeckel hat mit seiner ganzheitlichen Weltsicht versucht, Wissenschaft, Philosophie, Ethik und Kunst zusammenzuführen. Im vorliegenden Artikel werden seine Auseinandersetzung mit den Schönheiten der Natur und ihrem Anwendungsbezug dargestellt. Die Kunst solle sich Haeckels Auffassung zu Folge in ihrer Motivfindung vor allem an den Formen des Lebens orientieren. Diese betrachtete er als die höchsten Ausprägungen ästhetischer Erscheinungen. Durch sie solle der Mensch einen Zugang zur Natur gewinnen, zumal der Mensch nicht im Gegensatz zur Natur stehen dürfe. Künstlerisch hoch begabt, hat Haeckel selber durch die zeichnerische Darstellung tausender, meist mikroskopisch kleiner Organismen wesentliche Anregungen für einen solchen Weg gegeben. Zugleich hatte er mit seinen Zeichnungen Einblicke in zuvor weitgehend unbekannte natürliche Strukturen geboten. Auf diese Weise hat er in erheblichem Maße Einfluss auf die Malerei und Bildgestaltung, auf Schmuck‐ und Glaskunst, Architektur, Möbeldesign und Innenraumgestaltung um die Wende des 19. zum 20. Jahrhunderts genommen.

            Summary
            The influential evolutionary biologist Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919), well‐known as a highly disputatious defender of Darwin's work, sought to unite science, philosophy, ethics and art in an all‐embracing world view that he called „monism“. In this essay his ideas and reflections on aesthetics in nature and their application are reviewed. According to Haeckel, art should be based on motifs that are to be found in the diversity of life forms, which represent, in his opinion, the highest imagineable specification in aesthetics. Beauty in nature should open men's way to nature, and man must not place himself in opposition to nature. Haeckel himself, who was also a gifted artist, helped find the way to such an attitude by publishing thousands of drawings of organisms, mostly microscopically small marine species. His illustrations made organismic structures accessible that a broader public was previously almost unaware of. With these representations he was most influential in almost all areas of art around the turn of the century, including architecture, interior design, painting, glass art and furniture design.},

Exercise is a known immunomodulator; however, whether exercise causes long term changes in inflammatory responses and how these changes occur are lacking. Here, we show that chronic moderate intensity training of mice leads to persistent metabolic rewiring and changes to chromatin accessibility in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs), which, in turn, tempers their inflammatory responses. We show that BMDMs from exercised mice exhibited a decrease in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced NF-kB activation and pro-inflammatory gene expression along with an increase in M2-like associated genes when compared to BMDMs from sedentary mice. This was associated with improved mitochondrial quality and increased reliance on oxidative phosphorylation accompanied with reduced mitochondrial ROS production. Mechanistically, ATAC-seq analysis showed changes in chromatin accessibility of genes associated with inflammatory and metabolic pathways. Overall, our data suggest that chronic moderate exercise can influence the inflammatory responses of macrophages by reprogramming their metabolic and epigenetic landscape.},

Despite continuous improvements in fuel eﬃciency following the ﬂeet introduction of new families of jet aircraft and the associated engines, air travel remains the most carbon intensive mode of transportation. With aviation presently contributing around 2\% of global carbon emissions, multiple international organizations and national governments have set target to largely decarbonize the sector by 2050. However, the associated technical and economic challenges will require large-scale research and development expenditures. Already, research is being undertaken on large number of competing technologies, including battery-electric aircraft, hydrogen fuel-cells and various synthetic fuels and bio fuels. To ensure that the limited ﬁnancial resources available through public funding are allocated only to the most viable technologies, policy makers and research managers require reliable information about their environmental impact. In this context, life-cycle assessment has emerged as a major decision support tool. Following international standardization eﬀorts, the method is now widely used in academia and industry. However, present implementations are limited in both the precision and accuracy of their results.},

	abstract = {Global air transport today constitutes around 2\% of global carbon emissions [1]. Industry and policy makers have thus agreed to work towards "net-zero air transport by 2050" [2]. The required efficiency improvements thus necessitate novel aircraft designs and the large-scale production of synthetic fuels [2]. Modern passenger aircraft already burn 95\% less fuel per passenger kilometer than the first jet aircraft of the 1950s [3]. However, the underlying drivers of this improvement are still poorly understood. This is because overall efficiency is an aggregate metric, which is affected by aircraft weight, engine efficiency, drag, seat load factor, routing, operational procedures, etc. Some of these are limited by physics, others by economical considerations. In order to provide higher accuracy predictions about future air transport efficiency, it is necessary to better understand and dis-aggregate the exact contribution of technological improvements and other factors. of different improvements are still poorly understood. This will close a vital gap in our understanding of technological innovation in aviation.},

This study discusses two diagnostic tools for measuring the degree of architectural “beauty” and presents the results of the pilot application of one of them. The goal is to use diagnostic imaging for evaluations. Analytical elements are introduced from disciplines with which practitioners are normally not familiar, such as artiﬁcial intelligence, medicine, neuroscience, visual attention and image-processing software, etc. In addition to the diagnostic tools, this paper ties related ideas on objective beauty into a novel synthesis. These results support the idea of a feasible, “objective” way to evaluate what the users will consider as beautiful, and set the stage for an upcoming larger study that will quantitatively correlate the two methods.},

The temporal sequence of the ﬁrst few milliseconds of visual stimulus processing sheds light on the historically ambiguous topic of aesthetic experience. Automatic fractal processing triggers initial attraction/avoidance evaluations of an environment’s salubriousness, and its potentially positive or negative impacts upon an individual. As repeated cycles of visual perception occur, the attractiveness of urban form affects the user experience much more than had been previously suspected. These perceptual mechanisms promote walkability and intuitive navigation, and so they support the urban and civic interactions for which we establish communities and cities in the ﬁrst place. Therefore, the use of multiple fractals needs to reintegrate with biophilic and traditional architecture in urban design for their proven positive effects on health and well-being. Such beneﬁts include striking reductions in observers’ stress and mental fatigue. Due to their costs to individual well-being, urban performance, environmental quality, and climatic adaptation, this paper recommends that nontraditional styles should be hereafter applied judiciously to the built environment.},

Der SET-Plan definiert als langfristiges Ziel, eine kohlenstoffneutrale Wirtschaft und nachhaltige Energieversorgung zu verwirklichen und hierzu mit bahnbrechenden Neuerungen eine neue Technologiegeneration zu entwickeln. Europa spielt in der Fusionsforschung und der zugehörigen Technologie weltweit eine Vorreiterrolle. Durch den Bau und Betrieb von ITER wird eine solide wissenschaftlich-technologische Basis für die Entscheidung über weitere Schritte in Richtung von Fusion als einer reellen Energiequelle geschaffen werden. ITER ist von daher für die Bundesregierung ein wichtiges Projekt, das aufmerksamer Begleitung bedarf. ITER ist wegen großer Kostensteigerungen, Zeitverzögerungen und mangelhaftem Management in die Kritik geraten. Aus Sicht des Bundesministeriums für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) wird ein Erfolg von ITER vor allem von der Bewältigung noch vorhandener Risiken bei einigen komplexen Komponenten abhängen. Eine Gruppe unabhängiger Experten (siehe Anhang) wurde deshalb mit Schreiben des BMBF vom 12.02.2013 beauftragt, den derzeitigen Stand des Projektes zu begutachten. Hierbei sollten erstens die größten technischen Risiken bei den verschiedenen Komponenten und die Möglichkeiten, diese Risiken zu verringern, analysiert werden. Zweitens sollte der ursprüngliche und der vom F4E(Fusion for Energy)-Management aufgestellte Zeitplan verglichen, die Risiken für weitere Zeitverzögerungen untersucht und eine Abschätzung des Zeitpunkts einer Inbetriebnahme gemacht werden. Drittens wurden die Experten gebeten mögliche Implikationen mit Hinblick auf die Kosten aufzuzeigen. Viertens sollten Maßnahmen im Management benannt werden, die es ermöglichen die Risiken zu verringern, den Zeitplan einzuhalten und weiteren Kostensteigerungen zu verhindern. Zusammenfassung der Einschätzungen Die aus Sicht der Experten größten Risiken sind im Folgenden zusammengestellt und bewertet: Technische Risiken: Die von der Gruppe untersuchten technischen Risiken scheinen prinzipiell lösbar, erfordern aber vermutlich mehr Zeit und Mittel als augenblicklich geplant. Nach Abschluss der in weiten Teilen bereits erfolgten Auftragsvergaben bergen die Qualitätskontrolle im Produktionsprozess sowie die Integration/Montage der Komponenten einschließlich des Änderungsmanagements noch mögliche Risiken und zählen deshalb zu den wichtigsten Aufgaben der Projektleitung.},

	abstract = {The growing conflicts in and about oil exporting regions and speculations about volatile oil prices during the last decade have renewed the public interest in predictions for the near future oil production and consumption. Unfortunately, studies from only 10 years ago, which tried to forecast the oil production during the next 20-30 years, failed to make accurate predictions for today's global oil production and consumption. Forecasts using economic growth scenarios, overestimated the actual oil production, while models which tried to estimate the maximum future oil production/year, using the official country oil reserve data, predicted a too low production. In this paper, a new approach to model the maximal future regional and thus global oil production (part I) and consumption (part II) during the next decades is proposed. Our analysis of the regional oil production data during past decades shows that, in contrast to periods when production was growing and growth rates varied greatly from one country to another, remarkable similarities are found during the plateau and decline periods of different countries. Following this model, the particular production phase of each major oil producing country and region is determined essentially only from the recent past oil production data. Using these data, the model is then used to predict the production from all major oil producing countries, regions and continents up to the year 2050. The limited regional and global potential to compensate this decline with unconventional oil and oil-equivalents is also presented.},

Methods A case note review of all new patients attending a monthly, multidisciplinary vulva clinic over a 12-month period. Results The mean age of the 135 women was 43 years (range 18–86 years). The majority of patients, 64 (47\%), were referred by their general practitioner (GP). Using nurse and physician triage 85 (63\%) patients were seen by a dermatologist, 55 (41\%) by a genitourinary medicine physician, 38 (28\%) by a gynaecologist and six (4\%) by a psychosexual physician. Fifty-one (38\%) women required a consultation by at least two specialties. Itch was the most frequent presenting symptom (70\%) and 59 (44\%) women had experienced symptoms for between 6 months and 2 years. A previous STD screen had been performed in only 57 (42\%), which was negative in 45 (79\%). The most frequent initial clinical diagnoses were lichen sclerosus (35, 26\%), vaginal candidiasis (21, 16\%), vulvodynia (16, 12\%), lichen simplex chronicus (13, 10\%) and Bowenoid papulosis (13, 10\%). Thirty-eight (28\%) women had microbiological investigations revealing 13/135 (10\%) had vaginal candidiasis and two (2\%) bacterial vaginosis, all symptomatic. A biopsy was performed in 32 (24\%) confirming the initial diagnosis in 20 (63\%) cases. Treatment was initiated in 101 (75\%) women: 62 (46\%) were prescribed steroid cream, 46 (34\%) emollient cream and 22 (16\%) treatment for candida infection. Fifty-three (39\%) women received more than one treatment. 94 (70\%) patients were followed-up in the vulval clinic, five (4\%) in the genitourinary clinic and 12 (9\%) by their GP. Conclusions Despite having genitourinary symptoms less than half the patients had been tested for infection prior to attending the clinic. More than a third of the patients, 46 (34\%), were diagnosed with a genitourinary infection. There is a significant role for genitourinary services in the diagnosis, management and ongoing care of patients in a vulva clinic.},

	title = {An {Analysis} of the {Historical} {Development} of the {Energy} {Efficiency} for {Various} {Lighting} {Technologies}},
	abstract = {While energy statistics report data from a “supply side perspective,” the demand for energy services (incl. “illumination”) drives the need to convert “primary energy” to “useful energy” with the application of “conversion technologies” (Grubler et al., 2014). The availability of detailed reports containing luminous and radiant energy ﬁgures would enable a better assessment of the demand and provide incentives to address ineﬃciencies, for example, due to excessive use of artiﬁcial lighting with no or negligible gains in beneﬁt. For demand focused reporting, technological and methodological challenges need to be overcome. The lack of data concerning, for instance, average end-use conversion eﬃciencies, is often expressed within the literature (Paoli et al., 2018). After synthesizing fundamentals on technical energy eﬃciency from a body of literature related to lighting technologies, and addressing the challenges in linking photometric quantities to derive “electrical to light” conversion eﬃciencies, a historical overview of eﬃciencies is presented for “Best Available White-light Technologies,” including estimations for conversion eﬃciencies. Subsequently, a useful energy analysis is performed for the domestic sector in the UK with modelled data available from the “Department for Business, Energy \& Industrial Strategy” and the application of a calculated time series of conversion eﬃciencies for incandescent, halogen, compact ﬂuorescent and LED lamps for 12 years (2006-2018). The resulting average eﬃciencies stayed way below the state-ofthe-art conversion eﬃciencies of commercially available lighting technologies and evolved from 8.9\% (2006) to 13.5\% (2018) for a “base case” scenario. Finally, a more holistic view of illumination, covering inﬂuences on energy eﬃciency beyond product-based conversion eﬃciencies and eﬃcacies, concludes this work. In closing, an overview of sales volumes and indications for technological diﬀusion is provided for selected regions and countries. Although the replacement of kerosene-based, incandescent, and ﬂuorescent lamps with solid-state-lighting products should be treated with high priority, increasing demand and population growth together with rebound eﬀects may signiﬁcantly diminish the achievable eﬃciency gains. In the end, only a faster transition to low-carbon technologies within the whole energy system (away from fossil fuels), together with appropriate service levels, can mitigate environmental impacts due to CO2 emissions on a global scale.},

assessment of the current state of knowledge of the observed impacts and projected risks of climate change as well as the adaptation options. The report confirms the strong interactions of the natural, social and climate systems and that human-induced climate change has caused
widespread adverse impacts to nature and people. It is clear that across sectors and regions, the most vulnerable people and systems are disproportionately affected and climate extremes have led to irreversible impacts. The assessment underscores the importance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C if we are to achieve a fair, equitable and sustainable world. While the assessment concluded that there are feasible and effective adaptation options which can reduce risks to nature and people, it also found that there are limits to adaptation and that there is a need for increased ambition in both adaptation and mitigation. These and other findings confirm and enhance our understanding of the importance of climate resilient development across sectors and regions and, as such, demands the urgent attention of both policymakers and the general public.},

	abstract = {Background: A recent study examining Commercial Claims Insurance database found that many patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) do not remain on their initial TNF inhibitor two years after initiation, particularly women and those taking opioids.
Objectives: To examine factors associated with switching from one TNF inhibitor (i)agent to either another TNFi, IL-17i or JAKi over time (at {\textless}2years and {\textgreater}2 years) in a longitudinal cohort of AS patients.
Methods: Patients enrolled in the Prospective Study of Outcomes in AS (PSOAS), an observational longitudinal study of predictors of AS severity operative since 2002-2020 including over 1250 patients meeting modified New York criteria. Data collected included age, gender, ethnicity, HLA-B27 status, disease activity (BASDAI or ASDAS), erythocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), disease severity,(functional (BASFI) or radiographic (mSASSS)), comorbidities, smoking, exercise, disease duration, depression (either by self report or by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and other medication usage (NSAIDs, including the NSAID index, nonbiologic DMARDs, opioids, anti-depressants, anxiolytics and hypnotics). Logistic regression models were built to identify clinical and sociodemographic characterstics associated with medication switching to another TNFi, IL-17i, or other biologic therapy (another TNFi, Il-17i, or JAKi) within 2 years and after 2 years of initiation).
Results: Of those patients in PSOAS who had at least two years of follow-up, 496 were prescribed anti-TNF, 34 anti-IL-17 and 3 anti-JAK agents. According to the multinomial logistic regression analysis, patients who switched from their original TNFito another TNFi, IL-17i or JAKi within two years after initiating their original TNFi were more likely to be older, have higher baseline subjective disease activity (BASDAI), less radiographic severity by MSASSS, exercise {\textgreater} 120 minutes/week and less likely to be currently smoking. Patients who switched after two years were less likely be depressed, had shorter disease duration, had greater subjective disease activity, were more likely to be exercising {\textgreater} 120 minutes/week, and had more comorbidities.
Conclusion: Different factors were encountered in AS patients who switched from their initial TNFi to another TNFi, IL-17i or JAKi within 2 years versus after 2 years of treatment.},

Methods In the SELECT-AXIS 1 study, adults with active AS and an inadequate response to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were randomized to receive upadacitinib 15 mg once daily or placebo. At week 14, patients who had been randomized to receive placebo were switched to upadacitinib, and all patients continued in the open-label extension and received upadacitinib up to week 104; interim data up to week 64 are reported herein. Results Of 187 patients, 178 completed week 14 on study drug and entered the open-label extension. Similar proportions of patients in either group (continuous upadacitinib or placebo-to-upadacitinib) achieved Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society 40\% response (ASAS40) or Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) showing low disease activity at week 64: ≥70\% of patients achieved these end points based on nonresponder imputation (NRI) and ≥81\% based on as-observed analyses. Furthermore, ≥34\% (NRI) and ≥39\% (as-observed analysis) achieved ASDAS showing inactive disease or ASAS showing partial remission at week 64. Mean changes from baseline (week 0) to week 64 in pain, function, and inflammation showed consistent improvement or sustained maintenance through the study. Among 182 patients receiving upadacitinib (237.6 patient-years), 618 adverse events (260.1 per 100 patient-years) were reported. No serious infections, major adverse cardiovascular events, venous thromboembolic events, gastrointestinal perforation, or deaths were reported. Conclusion Upadacitinib 15 mg once daily showed sustained and consistent efficacy over 1 year.

	abstract = {The α-Fe2O3(11̅02) surface (also known as the hematite r-cut or (012) surface) was studied using low-energy electron diﬀraction (LEED), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM), and ab initio density functional theory (DFT)+U calculations. Two surface structures are stable under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions; a stoichiometric (1 × 1) surface can be prepared by annealing at 450 °C in ≈10−6 mbar O2, and a reduced (2 × 1) reconstruction is formed by UHV annealing at 540 °C. The (1 × 1) surface is close to an ideal bulk termination, and the undercoordinated surface Fe atoms reduce the surface bandgap by ≈0.2 eV with respect to the bulk. The work function is measured to be 5.7 ± 0.2 eV, and the VBM is located 1.5 ± 0.1 eV below EF. The images obtained from the (2 × 1) reconstruction cannot be reconciled with previously proposed models, and a new “alternating trench” structure is proposed based on an ordered removal of lattice oxygen atoms. DFT+U calculations show that this surface is favored in reducing conditions and that 4-fold-coordinated Fe2+ cations at the surface introduce gap states approximately 1 eV below EF. The work function on the (2 × 1) termination is 5.4 ± 0.2 eV.},

	abstract = {Flicker, the temporal modulation of light, is an unwanted eﬀect found in energy eﬃcient light bulbs. It is caused by cheap ballasts, the power supplies that are required for their operation. As energy eﬃcient light bulbs were pushed into consumer’s homes by EU and US energy eﬃciency regulations, it has become a health concern: Flicker has been linked to eyestrain, headaches and migraines. Literature and studies on these eﬀects were widely known by the time the ﬁrst energy eﬃciency legislation was passed. Complex and thus more expensive ballasts have always been able to provide high quality, ﬂicker free light, but were adopted only slowly. When ﬂuorescent lights made their way into consumer’s homes in the early 2000s, regulation was enacted that all but eliminated the ﬂicker caused by their ballasts. When it became clear that LEDs would soon replace their ﬂuorescent counterparts, no legislative action was taken to ensure the same performance standards. Instead, priority was given to lower lamp cost.This resulted in the widespread use of cheap power supplies in LED products released during the past decade. To consumers, the ﬂicker behavior of lamps seemed arbitrary and a general property of LED light bulbs, rather than the result of an inadequate, yet low-cost power supply. This led to reservations about the new technology amongst consumers. The latest EU lighting energy eﬃciency regulation (EU) 2019/2020 ﬁnally made LED based light bulbs ﬂicker free by enacting strict performance limits on ballast performance. The United Kingdom must adopt similar standards or risk seeing all those low-quality light bulbs that cannot be sold on the EU market on store shelves. This policy brief aims to inform about the fundamental cause of ﬂicker in artiﬁcial lighting, its negative eﬀects on wellbeing and considers the drivers of EU legislative response in support of advances in lighting technology.},

We ﬁnd that technological breakthroughs and process innovation contributed to performance improvements across the entire range of LED device sub-eﬃciencies, resulting in the overall increase in the lamp eﬃciency for the highest performing devices at a test current of 350mA from 5.8\% to 38.7\% between 2002 and 2020. We further develop a bottom-up manufacturing cost model with process-step resolution that captures improvements in throughput, yield and related costs of all relevant manufacturing steps, as well as economies of scale, to analyse progress in LED manufacturing cost structure between early manufacturing in 2002 and mature industry in 2020. We estimate that the cost of manufacturing low-power and mid-power light-emitting diode packages at a US location using state-of-the-art equipment has dropped from 1.11\$(2020) in 2002 to 0.05\$(2020) in 2020, a 95.5\% decrease. We also ﬁnd that the largest contribution to overall cost reduction has come from increase in wafer size, and that in 2020, LED chip packaging is the largest contributor to cost at 60\%.},

	abstract = {Hackmanite (Na8Al6Si6O24(Cl,S)2) exhibits reversible photochromism or tenebrescence (Latin tenebra, shadow), which can be induced by exposure to UV light. In this phenomenon the off-white mineral turns pink or purple, and the original color can be restored with visible light or heat. For this to happen, there must be traps in the material’s crystal structure, and in hackmanite the traps are chloride vacancies which are sites where a chloride ion should reside, but due to sulfur anions being present, the charge balance does not allow a chloride ion to enter the structure at some point near the sulfur ion. The incident UV photon excites a sulfur atom’s electron which gets trapped in the vacancy. This creates an F center (German Farbzentrum, color center) which absorbs visible light in the green-yellow part (520−540 nm) of the spectrum, causing the coloration of the material. The aim of this study was to gain knowledge on how particle radiation, exposure to Xrays and gamma radiation induce tenebrescence in hackmanites. The theoretical background reviews different types of radiation, current trends in radiation dosimetry and the use of thermoluminescence and optically stimulated luminescence in the ionizing radiation monitoring. Some theory about color spaces and representation models are discussed shortly. Finally, the X-ray analysis techniques used in the experimental section are reviewed. The experimental section focuses on the synthetically prepared hackmanite to gain knowledge on whether the material could be used as a novel application in the field of radiation detection and dosimetry. The section also contains specific instructions on how to make hackmanites and cast them as flexible tapes via the doctor blading method.},

Correlations between the genetic background of spondyloarthritis and inﬂammatory bowel diseases and the inﬂammatory processes involving gut microbiota have been established. This knowledge has allowed progress in pharmacological therapy. The role of diet in the pathogenesis and treatment of diseases pertaining to the HLA-B27 spectrum is of great signiﬁcance, considering possible future applications in individualized medicine. Diet impacts the composition of gut microbiota, representing a substrate for the synthesis of metabolites affecting the mucosal immune system. Certain pro-inﬂammatory mediators, such as emulsiﬁers and microparticles, induce a more profound cytokine response, promoting inﬂammation. Numerous diets, including the low-starch diet, the Mediterranean diet, diets with low contents of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (low-FODMAP diets), gluten-free diets and fasting, have been analysed and correlated with patients’ symptomatology and dietary adherence. The aim of this review is to provide an extensive perspective on the diets available to patients with spondyloarthritis and related immune-mediated disorders.},

	abstract = {Gut inflammation is strongly associated with spondyloarthritis (SpA), as exemplified by the high prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the even higher occurrence of subclinical gut inflammation in patients with SpA. The gut–joint axis of inflammation in SpA is further reinforced by similarities in immunopathogenesis at both anatomical sites and by the clinical success of therapies blocking TNF and IL-23 in IBD and in some forms of SpA. Many genetic risk factors are shared between SpA and IBD, and changes in the composition of gut microbiota are seen in both diseases. Current dogma is that inflammation in SpA initiates in the gut and leads to joint inflammation; however, although conceptually attractive, some research does not support this causal relationship. For example, therapies targeting IL-17A are efficacious in the joint but not the gut, and interfering with gut trafficking by targeting molecules such as α4β7 in IBD can lead to onset or flares of SpA. Several important knowledge gaps remain that must be addressed in future studies. Determining the true nature of the gut–joint axis has real-world implications for the treatment of patients with co-incident IBD and SpA and for the repurposing of therapeutics from one disease to the other.},

	abstract = {Subclinical gut inflammation occurring in patients affected by spondyloarthritis (SpA) is correlated with the severity of spine inflammation. Several evidences indicate that dysbiosis occurs in SpA, and that may modulate intestinal permeability and intestinal immune responses. The presence of intestinal dysbiosis is accompanied in SpA patients with the presence of zonulin-dependent alterations of gut-epithelial and gut-vascular barriers. The leakage of epithelial and endothelial surface layers is followed by the translocation of bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide and intestinal fatty acid binding protein, in the systemic circulation. These bacterial products may downregulate the expression of CD14 on circulating monocytes leading to an “anergic” phenotype. In the gut, IL-23 may induce the expansion of innate immune cells such as mucosal-associated invariant T cells, γδ T cells, and innate lymphoid cells of group 3 that through the interaction with MAdCAM1 may recirculate form the gut to the sites of SpA active inflammation. On the basis of these findings, gut inflammation observed in SpA patient seems to be not only an epiphenomenon of the on going systemic inflammatory process but may also represent the base camp in which inflammatory cells are activated and from whom they shuttle.},

Within alcohol drinkers, effect of increased alcohol intake (defined as {\textgreater} 14 units/week) was explored with moderate drinking (≤ 14 units/week) as reference. The study cohort comprised 229 axSpA patients and 76\% were male with mean age 46.5 years (SD ± 13.8). Alcohol drinking was reported by 64\%, with a median of 6 units per week among drinkers. Compared with non-drinkers, drinkers had lower BASDAI (β = − 0.83; 95\% CI − 1.49, − 0.17), ASDAS (β = − 0.36; 95\% CI − 0.66, − 0.05) and BASFI (β = − 1.40; 95\% CI − 2.12, − 0.68). These associations were in contrast to, and independent of, the detrimental effects of smoking, depression, and deprivation. Subgroup analysis in alcohol drinkers did not reveal significant associations between disease severity and increased alcohol intake. Stratified analyses by smoking revealed that in never-smokers without depression, alcohol was associated with greater reduction in disease activity: BASDAI (β = − 1.69; 95\% CI − 2.93, − 0.45), ASDAS (β = − 0.60; 95\% CI − 1.18, − 0.02). Favourable axSpA disease activity and function were observed in association with alcohol consumption in this cross-sectional study.

	abstract = {Background: Little evidence is available about the impact of diet on disease activity of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). This study evaluated the impact of a 6-month nutritional advice based on the Mediterranean diet on the disease activity of axSpA.
Methods: We prospectively collected the information of a group of axSpA patients who were offered nutritional advice for a 6-month period, who were compared to axSpA patients followed at the same center who were not on a specific diet. A nutritionist gave suggestions for dietary modification at baseline and thereafter every 2 months until month 6. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was evaluated with the PREDIMED questionnaire ranging from 0 (no adherence) to 10 (optimal adherence); disease activity was evaluated with ASDAS-CRP. A multivariable regression analysis was conducted to identify independent predictors of PREDIMED and of ASDAS-CRP improvement (improvement ≥ 20\% of each score).
Results: A total of 161 patients were included: 81 receiving nutritional advice and 80 controls; 47 in the nutritional group and 63 controls had complete information until month 6. Overall, 40 (36.4\%) were females, the mean age was 51.7 ± 1.3 years, and 58 (52.7\%) were affected with psoriasis. No relevant change of anthropometric or laboratory measures was observed in either group. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was moderate (PREDIMED score 6.7 ± 1.8 at baseline; 7.6 ± 2.1 at month 6) and improved more in the nutritional group compared to controls (p = 0.020). Predictors of a PREDIMED improvement ≥ 20\% were receiving nutritional advice (OR 4.53, 1.36–15.1, p = 0.014), age (per 10-year increase OR 1.05, 1.02–1.68, p = 0.007), and BMI (OR 0.77, 0.63–0.9, p = 0.006). An ASDASCRP improvement ≥ 20\% was more frequent in the nutritional group compared to controls (p = 0.020). A PREDIMED improvement ≥ 20\% was associated with a ASDAS-CRP improvement ≥ 20\% (OR 6.75,1.8–25.3, p = 0.005). Psoriasis and disease duration were negatively but not significantly associated to the ASDAS-CRP improvement.
Conclusions: Improving adherence to the Mediterranean diet may have a beneficial impact on the activity of axSpA. Patients with a lower BMI and older patients are more prone to modify their diet towards the Mediterranean diet following nutritional advice. Patients with psoriasis may have a limited benefit from dietary improvement.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              Subclinical intestinal inflammation and gut dysbiosis have been reported in patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA). In common practice, rheumatologists are increasingly confronted with patients with inflammatory rheumatism who are on gluten-free diets (GFDs), despite the lack of reliable data from controlled studies. This study aims to determine the impact of a GFD on the quality of life of patients with axial SpA.
            
            
              Methods and analysis
              The GlutenSpA study is a 24-week, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. Patients with axial SpA (n=200) will follow a 16-week GFD and be randomly assigned (1:1) to an experimental or control arm. In the experimental arm with receive at least 6 gluten-free breads per day + 200 g of gluten-free penne pasta per week + 6 rice flavour capsules per day. The control arm will receive at least 6 gluten-containing breads per day + 200 g of gluten-containing penne pasta per week + 6 vital gluten-containing capsules per day. The primary end-point is the variation in Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society—Health Index (ASAS-HI) questionnaire between week 16 and baseline. A second open-label period of 8 weeks will follow the intervention period, during which the patient will be free to decide whether they will follow the GFD. The secondary outcomes comprise several patient-reported outcomes (SpA activity (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index)), fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy), depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), functional disability index (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index)), variations in body mass index and Homeostasis Model Assessment Index and variations in the abundance and type of bacterial species found in the gut microbiota for a subgroup of patients (n=40). The data will be analysed using the intention-to-treat principle.
              The regional ethics committee (CPP Nord-ouest IV) has approved the study (IDRCB 2018-A00309-46). The results of the trial will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

Furthermore, carriage of klebsiella did not correlate with any of the following parameters of disease activity measured in the outpatient clinic: morning stiffness, pain measured on a visual analogue scale, analgesic consumption, ESR, total serum IgA. We found no evidence, therefore, that faecal klebsiella is involved in disease exacerbations of ankylosing spondylitis.},

              , is the most likely triggering factor involved in the initiation and development of these diseases. Increased starch consumptions by genetically susceptible individuals such as those possessing HLA-B27 allelotypes could trigger the disease in both AS and CD by enhancing the growth and perpetuation of the

	abstract = {Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis mainly affecting the spinal joints. It would appear that the most likely causative agent in the development of AS is an environmental factor in the genetically susceptible, HLA-B27 positive, individuals. Extensive data from several countries support the notion that Klebsiella pneumonia bacteria are the most likely culprit in the causation of AS. These microbes possess antigens which resemble HLA-B27 and spinal collagens. Increased intake of high-starch diet is directly proportional to the gutassociated bacterial load, especially in the large intestine, and among these microbial agents, Klebsiella is considered as one of the main constituting components. Therefore, a low-starch diet intake alongside the currently used medical therapeutic modalities could be beneficial in the management of patients with early AS. It is suggested that a change in the dietary habits from high protein, low-starch marine components to the Westernized high-starch diet among the Inuit peoples of Alaska and Canada could be considered as one of the main contributing factors in the increased prevalence of AS during the last few decades within this genetically unmixed native population.},

Methods: 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was performed on fecal DNA isolated from stool samples in consecutive cross-sectional cohorts. Alpha and beta diversities were assessed using QIIME, and comparisons were performed using one-way ANOVA, Student's t-test, and SKN multiple range comparisons to examine differences between groups and a correlation network analysis was performed.
Results: We investigated 207 samples from 103 AS patients and 104 HCs. Alpha diversity was not significant difference in AS compared with HCs. For the community structure, Bacteroidetes was the most represented class. Megamonas, Dorea, and Blautia were significantly greater in AS than in HCs, whereas the abundance of Lachnospira, Ruminococcus, and Clostridium\_XlVb was significantly lower in AS than in HCs. In addition, Specific gut microbiome was significantly correlated with disease activity and dietary factors.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that the human gut microbiome of AS patients was clearly different from that of HCs and bacteria communities are associated with dietary factors and disease activity.},

Since about 10 years he therefore had pain in the iliosacral region. Numerous sessions of physiotherapy, a cure treatment, and treatment with sulfasalazine and doxycycline were not effective. The patient was dependent on the daily intake of the nonsteroidal antirheumatics meloxicam 2 × 7.5 mg and ibuprofen 400 – 800 mg and the analgetic tramadol 50 –150 mg, but evening and night pain and morning stiffness persisted under this treatment. Treatment: We recommended a temporary vegan diet, i.e. to completely avoid animal fats and proteins. Course: 3 – 4 days after changing on vegan diet the complaints improved distinctly and persistently. After consumption of meat 6 weeks later, complaints worsened. Consequent vegan diet again resulted in significant improvement of the pain and morning stiffness. At follow-up 3 months after the initial contact, tramadol and ibuprofen intakes had been stopped, meloxicam had been reduced to 1 × 7.5 mg. The patient was almost completely free of complaints. Conclusions: It was demonstrated that in a single case of sacroilitiis which was refractory to other treatment, vegan diet resulted in a convincingly improvement of complaints.},

            Forecasting is essential to design efforts to address climate change.

We assess their performance by generating probabilistic cost forecasts of energy technologies rooted at various years in the past and then comparing these with observed costs in 2019. Model-based methods outperformed expert elicitations both in terms of capturing 2019 observed values and producing forecast medians that were closer to the observed values. However, all methods underestimated technological progress in almost all technologies. We also produce 2030 cost forecasts and find that elicitations generally yield narrower uncertainty ranges than model-based methods and that model-based forecasts are lower for more modular technologies.

            We conduct a systematic comparison of technology cost forecasts produced by expert elicitation methods and model-based methods. Our focus is on energy technologies due to their importance for energy and climate policy. We assess the performance of several forecasting methods by generating probabilistic technology cost forecasts rooted at various years in the past and then comparing these with observed costs in 2019. We do this for six technologies for which both observed and elicited data are available. The model-based methods use either deployment (Wright’s law) or time (Moore’s law) to forecast costs. We show that, overall, model-based forecasting methods outperformed elicitation methods. Their 2019 cost forecast ranges contained the observed values much more often than elicitations, and their forecast medians were closer to observed costs. However, all methods underestimated technological progress in almost all technologies, likely as a result of structural change across the energy sector due to widespread policies and social and market forces. We also produce forecasts of 2030 costs using the two types of methods for 10 energy technologies. We find that elicitations generally yield narrower uncertainty ranges than model-based methods. Model-based 2030 forecasts are lower for more modular technologies and higher for less modular ones. Future research should focus on further method development and validation to better reflect structural changes in the market and correlations across technologies.},

	abstract = {Purpose Some LCA software tools use precalculated aggregated datasets because they make LCA calculations much quicker. However, these datasets pose problems for uncertainty analysis. Even when aggregated dataset parameters are expressed as probability distributions, each dataset is sampled independently. This paper explores why independent sampling is incorrect and proposes two techniques to account for dependence in uncertainty analysis. The first is based on an analytical approach, while the other uses precalculated results sampled dependently.
Methods The algorithm for generating arrays of dependently presampled aggregated inventories and their LCA scores is described. These arrays are used to calculate the correlation across all pairs of aggregated datasets in two ecoinvent LCI databases (2.2, 3.3 cutoff). The arrays are also used in the dependently presampled approach. The uncertainty of LCA results is calculated under different assumptions and using four different techniques and compared for two case studies: a simple water bottle LCA and an LCA of burger recipes.
Results and discussion The meta-analysis of two LCI databases shows that there is no single correct approximation of correlation between aggregated datasets. The case studies show that the uncertainty of single-product LCA using aggregated datasets is usually underestimated when the correlation across datasets is ignored and that the magnitude of the underestimation is dependent on the system being analysed and the LCIA method chosen. Comparative LCA results show that independent sampling of aggregated datasets drastically overestimates the uncertainty of comparative metrics. The approach based on dependently presampled results yields results functionally identical to those obtained by Monte Carlo analysis using unit process datasets with a negligible computation time.
Conclusions Independent sampling should not be used for comparative LCA. Moreover, the use of a one-size-fits-all correction factor to correct the calculated variability under independent sampling, as proposed elsewhere, is generally inadequate. The proposed approximate analytical approach is useful to estimate the importance of the covariance of aggregated datasets but not for comparative LCA. The approach based on dependently presampled results provides quick and correct results and has been implemented in EcodEX, a streamlined LCA software used by Nestlé. Dependently presampled results can be used for streamlined LCA software tools. Both presampling and analytical solutions require a preliminary one-time calculation of dependent samples for all aggregated datasets, which could be centrally done by database providers. The dependent presampling approach can be applied to other aspects of the LCA calculation chain.},

Yet, a full Monte Carlo analysis of a large LCA system, for instance containing the 4,000 unit processes of ecoinvent v2.2, is rarely carried out by LCA practitioners. One reason for this is computation time. An alternative faster than Monte Carlo method is analytical error propagation by means of a Taylor series expansion; however, this approach suffers from being explained in the literature in conflicting ways, hampering implementation in most software packages for LCA. The purpose of this paper is to compare the two different approaches from a theoretical and practical perspective.},

	abstract = {An American epistemic community played a key role in creating the international shared understanding and practice of nuclear arms control. In the absence of nuclear war, leaders' expectations of nuclear war and of its control were affected by causal theories and abstract propositions and models which, given their “scientific” and technical nature, were developed by an epistemic community. This study, which emphasizes the roles played by epistemic communities in policy innovation and in the diffusion of understandings across nations and communities, analyzes how the theoretical and practical ideas of the arms control epistemic community became political expectations, were diffused to the Soviet Union, and were ultimately embodied in the 1972 antiballistic missile (ABM) arms control treaty. In contrast to those studies that have concentrated primarily on the workings of international epistemic communities, this study stresses the notion that domestically developed theoretical expectations, which were worked out by a national group of experts and selected by the American government as the basis for negotiations with the Soviets, became the seed of the ABM regime. Moreover, by suggesting that the arms control epistemic community was really an aggregation of several factions that shared common ground against various intellectual and policy rivals, this study sheds light on the question of how much coherence an epistemic community requires. The political selection of new conceptual understandings, followed by their retention and diffusion at national and international levels, suggests an evolutionary approach at odds with explanations of international change advanced by structural realism and approaches based on it.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The modern project of creating human-like artificial intelligence (AI) started after World War II, when it was discovered that electronic computers are not just number-crunching machines, but can also manipulate symbols. It is possible to pursue this goal without assuming that machine intelligence is identical to human intelligence. This is known as weak AI. However, many AI researcher have pursued the aim of developing artificial intelligence that is in principle identical to human intelligence, called strong AI. Weak AI is less ambitious than strong AI, and therefore less controversial. However, there are important controversies related to weak AI as well. This paper focuses on the distinction between artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial narrow intelligence (ANI). Although AGI may be classified as weak AI, it is close to strong AI because one chief characteristics of human intelligence is its generality. Although AGI is less ambitious than strong AI, there were critics almost from the very beginning. One of the leading critics was the philosopher Hubert Dreyfus, who argued that computers, who have no body, no childhood and no cultural practice, could not acquire intelligence at all. One of Dreyfus’ main arguments was that human knowledge is partly tacit, and therefore cannot be articulated and incorporated in a computer program. However, today one might argue that new approaches to artificial intelligence research have made his arguments obsolete. Deep learning and Big Data are among the latest approaches, and advocates argue that they will be able to realize AGI. A closer look reveals that although development of artificial intelligence for specific purposes (ANI) has been impressive, we have not come much closer to developing artificial general intelligence (AGI). The article further argues that this is in principle impossible, and it revives Hubert Dreyfus’ argument that computers are not in the world.},

	abstract = {Structural decomposition analysis (SDA) is a well-known methodology to assess the relative importance of effects that together constitute the actual change in a variable of interest. A widely recognized problem of SDA is that the results often depend strongly on the speciﬁc decomposition formula chosen, while numerous formulae are equivalent from a theoretical point of view. This ‘non-uniqueness’ problem is often solved rather pragmatically, by reporting an average over (a subset of) all possible formulae. In this paper, we propose an approach that uses maximum entropy econometrics techniques to select a speciﬁc decomposition formula if additional information on one or more (but not all) determinants is available. We illustrate the method empirically by investigating the sources of change in real labour costs by industry in Spain, 1980– 1994.},

	abstract = {Structural decomposition techniques are widely used to break down the growth in some variable into the changes in its determinants. In this paper, we discuss the problems caused by the existence of a multitude of equivalent decomposition forms which are used to measure the contribution of a specijic determinant. Although it is well known that structural decompositions are not unique, the extent of the problem and its consequences seem to have been largely neglected. In an empirical analysisfor The Netherlands between 1986 and 1992, results are calculatedfor 24 equivalent decompositionforms. The outcomes exhibit a large degree of variability across the different forms. We also examine the two approaches that have been used predominantly in the literature. The average of the two so-called polar decompositions appears to be remarkably close to the average of the full set of 24 decompositions. The approximate decomposition with mid-point weights appears to be almost exact. Although this last alternative might seem a solution to the problem of the marked sensitivity, in fact, it only conceals the problem.},
